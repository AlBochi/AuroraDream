# Aurora Dream - Design Guidelines

## Design Philosophy
**Art Direction**: Minimalist Nordic spa meets modern tech blog. Clean Apple News-style layouts with luxury retreat warmth. Space is as important as content.

**Interaction**: Smooth, deliberate, gentle. All transitions subtle and calming. Never pressured—always calm and informed.

## Color Palette (Exact Implementation)
- **#0A3A57** (Navy Blue): Primary background for footer, fixed navbar, major containers
- **#F3E8D0** (Soft Sand): Primary text color on dark backgrounds, all body text and headings
- **#3A7BF7** (Aurora Blue): Primary action color for CTAs, key headlines, hover states
- **Aurora Gradient**: Horizontal blend #19B9C4 → #3A7BF7 → #A861D5 for hero background and section titles (ethereal, not overwhelming)
- **#FFEBB5** (Star Glow): Micro-accent for star icons, subtle text-shadows on key words

## Typography
- **Font Stack**: System fonts with 'Inter' or 'SF Pro' ideal
- **Hierarchy**: Hero headline (boldest) → Section titles (strong) → Body text (soft, line-height ≥ 1.6)
- **Style**: Highly readable, clear, spacious

## Layout System
- **Spacing**: Generous padding, breathing room between sections
- **Grid**: 3-column on desktop, single column on mobile
- **Containers**: Full-width sections with centered content areas
