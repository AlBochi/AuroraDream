I am sending you our company logo. Replace the text '[Aurora Dream]' at the top left of the navigation bar with this logo. Ensure it is sized appropriately and links to the homepage (the top of the page).

Revise the entire page design and structure with these new directives:

1. Navigation Bar (Updated):

Left: Integrated Logo.

Right: About | Our Products | Book an Appointment | Contact Us

Style: Clean, minimalist, fixed to the top. Background should be semi-transparent to let the moving sky theme show through slightly.

2. Core Creative Theme - 'Living Aurora Sky':

The primary background theme for the entire page should be a stylized, animated sky of the aurora borealis.

Visual: Create a deep blue (#0A3A57) base sky with soft, slow-moving gradients in our brand colors (#19B9C4, #3A7BF7, #A861D5). The motion should be subtle, like gentle waves or flowing light—calm and mesmerizing, not distracting.

Implementation: This likely requires a procedurally generated background using HTML Canvas or a lightweight JavaScript library. Prioritize performance; the motion must be smooth but not resource-heavy.

3. Content Presentation Over the Sky:

All text, cards, and sections must sit clearly on top of this animated sky. Use semi-transparent backgrounds or very subtle backdrops for text sections to ensure perfect readability (#F3E8D0 text color is mandatory).

The 'Book Your Private Fitting' button must pop strongly against the motion.

4. Design Philosophy:

Less is more. With this dynamic background, every other element must be even cleaner, more minimalist, and use more negative space. The moving sky is the main artwork; the interface should frame it.

Goal: The user should feel like they are looking through a window into a calm, Canadian night sky while browsing a premium sleep studio's offerings.

Deliverable:
First, show me a design prototype of this living aurora sky theme with the updated navigation and hero section. I must approve the motion aesthetic and readability before you build the full site."
